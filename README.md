You may use this for any server or anything, change the name of the plugin, but you CANNOT remove me from the authors.

### Introduction

My name is LBuddyBoy or Ethan and I have started a base of a rank core that I will be working on as much as I can and this will be a fun project for me and hopefully helpful for anyone that wants to use it.

### Information

I suggest using Redis, so that you get the full experience of this core.
I will also be doing updates very often on this, so dm me on Telegram or Discord if you have any suggestions on what to add.
